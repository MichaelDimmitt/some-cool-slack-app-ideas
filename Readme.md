## cool slack ideas
1) When I am chatting with someone always show the time that they have currently whether we are in the same timezone or not.
Slack currently shows this but only when they have wierd hours like working at 6:30 am their time.
2) Improve breakouts off General Channel.<br/>
Essentially everything in slack runs of General Channel.<br/><br/>
People post recruiting stuff or Dev ops questions and we tell them post it in that channel<br/>
But they do not do it ... ðŸ˜ª<br/><br/>
They post in general to get higher visibility.<br/><br/>
How can we encourage channel use?<br/><br/>
This app will let you know the activity in other channels and inform general<br/><br/>
example: 50 messages have occured in Recruiting!<br/><br/>
The post continually is edited and no new posts are added to general.<br/>
This way people in general can quickly click and go to the channel that has the action and answer questions.
